## Namaste there üôè, I'm Kunal Gautam.

Born and educated in India, I'm very passionate about Technology. My area of interest is User Experience, Education, Meteorology, Electronics and Wireless Communications.

With over 10 Years of experience in developing Websites, I have learnt a lot about good user experience.  I'm right now freelancing under the name of [AbhashTech](https://abhashtech.com).

I'm a supporter of using quality education available to everyone. According to me, education should be available to everyone at an affordable cost. As of now, I'm working to chalk-out feasibility for creating quality content for education, by analysing options and cost-effectiveness. I'm learning about integrating microcontroller, frameworks and algorithms, and how to reap out the maximum out of it for creating quality content.
